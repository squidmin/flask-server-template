### Additional Suggestions

- **`gunicorn` for Production:** For production use, it's recommended to use a more robust WSGI HTTP Server like gunicorn instead of the built-in Flask server. You would need to add `gunicorn` to your `requirements.txt` and change the CMD in the Dockerfile to something like `CMD ["gunicorn", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]`.
- **Configuration Files:** For more complex applications, consider adding configuration files for your Flask app and gunicorn, if you decide to use it.
- **Logging:** Ensure that logs are being correctly managed and are accessible. For Docker, logs will typically be accessible via `docker logs <container_id>`.
